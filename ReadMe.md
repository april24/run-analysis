####Prepare tidy data for "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" 
####that can be used for later analysis.

 
 
 Here are the steps:
 
a.Read in the dataset in "test"/"train".

b.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

c.Combine three datasets in "test"/"train".

d.Merge "test"" and "train" into one dataset.

e.Attach the column headers to the dataset with information in "features" and "activity_labels".

d.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.Choose column names in the features include mean() and std() .

f.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

g.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
